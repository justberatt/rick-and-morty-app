# React Vite App

This is a React application built with Vite. I have used TypeScript and with it a GraphQL Code Generator to keep the frontend's type definitions consistent with the backend should the schema change.

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/justberatt/rick-and-morty-app.git

cd rick-and-morty-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Running the App

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

Thank you and enjoy.
